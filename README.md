# üê∂ end- to end multiclass dog breed classification 
this notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier sing tensorflow 2.0 and tensorflow hub

## 1. problem

Identfiting breeds of dogs given an image of a image

## 2. data

Using data drom kaggle
identification competition

## 3. Evaluation

The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image
